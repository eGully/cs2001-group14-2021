### Project Idea 

As a group, we have decided to create a web application targeted towards students that helps you quickly find a workout or meal. It will take parameters such as time you have available in order to tailor the results specific to you. 

### (SDG #3- Good Health and Well-being)

### Motivation: 

Often, people resort to eating fast food or frozen ready to eat food when they do not have time to research recipes and decide what to eat. Repeatedly consuming these types of food can lead to obesity and other health problems such as premature heart disease. Our web applications aims to solve this by quickly providing you with healthy options based on your preferences. This application is catered specifically towards students to help them to find a workout/ meal plan which meets their schedule.
